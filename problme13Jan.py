#1: Write a Python program to check string how many vowels and consonant
# str1=input('Enter the string :' )
# vowels=0
# consonant=0
# for i in str1:
#     if i in  "AEIOUaeiou":
#         vowels=vowels+1
#     else:
#         consonant=consonant+1
# print("total vowels num is ",vowels)  
# print("total consonant num is ",consonant)  



'''2: Write a Python program that accepts a string and calculate the number of digits and letters. For multiples of three print "Fizz"
 instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five
 print "FizzBuzz".
 '''

# for i in range(1,100):
#     if i%3==0:
#        print('Fizz') 
#     elif i%5==0:
#         print('Buzz')   
#     elif i%3==0 and i%5:
#         print('FizzBuzz')
#     else:
#         print('number')    



#3: Write a Python program which takes two digits m (row) and n (column) as input and generates a two-dimensional array.


# m=int(input('Enter the row :'))
# n=int(input('Enter the colum :'))
# for i in range(m):
#     for j in range(n):
#      print(m,n)       



#4: Write a Python program which iterates the integers from 1 to 50.

# n =int(input("Enter the number :"))
# for i in range(1,n+1,1):
#     print('iterates the integers from 1 to',n,'is',i)     



'''5: Write a Python program to check the validity of password input by users. Go to the editor
Validation :
	At least 1 letter between [a-z] and 1 letter between [A-Z].
	At least 1 number between [0-9].
	At least 1 character from [$#@].
	Minimum length 6 characters.'''
