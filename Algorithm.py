# Algorithm1: Calculating Target Variables
# 1. Assign values to variables
# a = 1-1 semester percentage, b= 1-2 semester percentage
# c= 2-1 semester percentage, d = 2-2 semester percentage
# e= 3-1 semester percentage, f = 3-2 semester Percentage
# g = Attendance percentage, h = extracurricular activities
# i = Academic awards and achievements, j = Coding skills
# k = semester_grades=[a,b,c,d,e,f]
# 2.Calculate dropout
# dropout = 1 if min(k) < 35 and g < 30 else 0
# 3.Calculate good performance
# good_performance = 1 if all(grade > 60 for grade in k) else 0
# 4.Calculate poor performance
# poor_performance = 1 if max(k) < 40 else 0
# 5.Calculate support required
# support_required = 1 if any(40 <= grade < 60 for grade in k) else 0
# 6.Calculate eligibility for placement
# eligible_for_placement = 1 if all(grade > 65 for grade in k) and (j or i or h) else 0
# Algorithm 2: LSTM for Student Academic Performance Evaluation:
# Description: This algorithm analyzes student performance using an LSTM model. The input data includes 
# student academic performance metrics, and the output is a prediction of good performers, poor 
# performers, students who require support and the dropouts
# Input: semester percentages
# Output: A binary classification indicating whether a student is a good performer or bad performer or 
# requiring support or dropout

# Assigning values to the variables
a = 95
b = 85
c = 75
d = 90
e = 75
f = 80
g = 90
m = True
n= True
o = True
semester_grades = [a, b, c, d, e, f]

# Calculating dropout
if min(semester_grades) < 35 and g < 30:
    dropout = 1
else:
    dropout = 0
print("dropout:", dropout)

# Calculating good performance
if all(grade > 60 for grade in semester_grades):
    good_performance = 1
else:
    good_performance = 0
print('good_performance:', good_performance)

# Calculating poor performance
if max(semester_grades) < 40:
    poor_performance = 1
else:
    poor_performance = 0
print('poor_performance:',poor_performance)

# Calculating support required
if any(40 <= grade < 60 for grade in semester_grades):
    support_required = 1
else:
    support_required = 0
print('support_required:', support_required)

# Calculating eligibility for placement
if all(grade > 65 for grade in semester_grades) and (m or n or o):

# Procedure:
# 1. Import required libraries for data analysis, data cleaning, visualization, and LSTM modeling.
# 2. Load the dataset of student academic performance metrics 
# 3. Clean the data 
# 4. Evaluate the academic performance of good performers, poor performers, student who require 
# support, student dropouts, students with placement eligibility by calculating their cumulative 
# percentage and display the output.
# 5. Visualize the critical values as graphs across all students 
# 6. Visualize the critical values as graphs across all students
# 7. Prepare the data for the LSTM model by separating input features and the target variable.
# 8. Split the data into training and testing sets 
# 9. Reshape the input data into the required format for LSTM modeling.
# 10. Build and compile the LSTM model 
# 11. Train the LSTM model on the training data.
# 12. Evaluate the LSTM model and print accuracies of trained LSTM model.
